# Experimental Zener Diode Tester

![Prototype version of Automatic Zener diode tester](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dilshan/simple-zener-tester/master/resources/zener-tester-prototype1.jpg)

Automatic Zener diode tester is capable of identifying Zener diodes up to 27.5V. Apart from that, it can be used to recognize leads of the diodes/Zeners and detect damaged diodes.

This tester is designed using well-known ICs such as MC34063 and PIC16F88.

This unit provides approximately 5% to 15% accurate readings. Based on our observations, the accuracy of this unit can increase by using resistors with 1% tolerance, stable booster circuit, accurate sampling method(s), and with a more optimized PCB layout.
